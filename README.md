Conky Collection
================
The Conky Collection is collection of [Conky](http://conky.sourceforge.net/) setups for Linux users. Each folder contains a completely independent Conky setup with the accompanying information necessary to get the setup working on your computer.

Dependencies
============
Each Conky setup may require different dependencies; therefore, dependencies will be listed in the README.md file located in the main folder of a particular configuration. For the sake of simplicity, a simple bash script will be included with each configuration that will check for and install any missing dependencies.  

Contributing
============
Pull requests which address errors or provide improvements to existing files are welcome, however pull requests for new Conky configurations will not be accepted at this time.
